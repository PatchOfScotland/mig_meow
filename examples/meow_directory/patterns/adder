# This file defines a MEOW Pattern.

# The Patterns name is taken from the filename, so this Pattern would be called 'adder'.

# The input_file is a special variable name to be replace in the Recipe within Jobs. It is the variable name for a string containing the path of the trigger event. In this case, the event path will be assigned to the variable 'infile' in the Recipe.
input_file: infile

# Input paths are all the triggering paths for this Pattern. This is a regular path though the '*' wildcard character will be used to match any number of intermediate characters. In this case the Pattern will trigger on any data inside the 'intial_data' directory. 
input_paths:
- initial_data/*

# output are variables to be replaced in the Recipe. There are used in the visualisation of a MEOW workflow. Other than that they are treated the same as variables. In this case we are using some in-built keywords to construct a path at runtime. 
output:
  outfile: '{VGRID}/data_added/{FILENAME}'

# We can specify that multiple jobs should be scheduled with different values for a parameter using a parameter sweep. In this case 3 jobs will be scheduled, with the values 1, 2, abd 3 for the variable 'extra'
parameterize_over:
  extra:
    increment: 1
    start: 1
    stop: 3

# This is the recipe we will use to run the triggered jobs. In this case we will use the recipe 'add'
recipes:
- add

# Any additional variables to be replaced in the jobs are defined here. In this case there are no additional variables.
variables: {}

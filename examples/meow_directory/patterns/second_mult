# This file defines a MEOW Pattern.

# The Patterns name is taken from the filename, so this Pattern would be called 'second_mult'.

# The input_file is a special variable name to be replace in the Recipe within Jobs. It is the variable name for a string containing the path of the trigger event. In this case, the event path will be assigned to the variable 'infile' in the Recipe.
input_file: infile

# Input paths are all the triggering paths for this Pattern. This is a regular path though the '*' wildcard character will be used to match any number of intermediate characters. In this case the Pattern will trigger on any '.npy' data inside the 'data_1' directory.
input_paths:
- data_1/data_*.npy

# output are variables to be replaced in the Recipe. There are used in the visualisation of a MEOW workflow. Other than that they are treated the same as variables. In this case we are using some in-built keywords to construct a path at runtime.
output:
  outfile: '{VGRID}/data_2/{FILENAME}'

# We can specify that multiple jobs should be scheduled with different values for a parameter using a parameter sweep. In this case no parameter sweep will be performed.
parameterize_over: {}

# This is the recipe we will use to run the triggered jobs. In this case we will use the recipe 'mult'
recipes:
- mult

# Any additional variables to be replaced in the jobs are defined here. In this case we will overwrite the 'factor' variable in the Recipe with the value 3.
variables:
  factor: 3
